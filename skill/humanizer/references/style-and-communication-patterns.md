# Style and Communication Patterns

## STYLE PATTERNS

### 14. Em Dashes (and En Dashes): Cut Them

**Rule:** In general-purpose prose, inspect em dashes (—), en dashes (–), and double hyphens (` -- `) as possible AI-shaped punctuation. Replace decorative or repeated uses when a clearer sentence works. Do not remove a dash when a user sample, technical convention, identifier, legal/reference style, or precise parenthetical relationship makes it the better choice.
**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.
**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.
**Before:**
> The new policy — announced without warning — affects thousands of workers. The changes -- long overdue according to critics -- will take effect immediately.
**After:**
> The new policy, announced without warning, affects thousands of workers. The changes, long overdue according to critics, will take effect immediately.

Before returning a general-purpose rewrite, scan it for `—` and `–`. Apply this priority:
technical meaning and factual contract, user sample and repository convention, readability,
then generic AI-pattern cleanup. Remove repeated or decorative dashes rather than breaking
the document's convention.

### 15. Overuse of Boldface
**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.
**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.
**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.

### 16. Inline-Header Vertical Lists
**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons.
**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.
**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.

### 17. Title Case in Headings
**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.
**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships
**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships

### 18. Emojis
**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis.
**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting
**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.

### 19. Curly Quotation Marks
**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes (“...”) instead of straight quotes ("...").
**Before:**
> He said “the project is on track” but others disagreed.
**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

## COMMUNICATION PATTERNS

### 20. Collaborative Communication Artifacts

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Want me to give examples?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...
**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.
**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.
**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

### 21. Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers and Speculative Gap-Filling

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information, not publicly available, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, prefers to stay out of the spotlight, likely [grew up/studied/began], it is believed that
**Problem:** Two related tells. (a) Older models leave hard knowledge-cutoff disclaimers in the text. (b) When a model can't find a source, it writes a paragraph *about* not finding one and then invents plausible filler to cover the gap. For a private person the guess almost always lands on the same stock phrases ("maintains a low profile," "keeps personal details private"), none of it sourced. Say what isn't known, or cut the sentence; don't dress a guess up as fact.
**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.
**After:**
> The company's founding date is not documented in the available sources. (Or cut the sentence. State a date only if a source provides one.)
**Before (speculative gap-fill):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile and keeps personal details private. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.
**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)

### 22. Sycophantic/Servile Tone
**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.
**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.
**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.

## Use these patterns proportionally

A style feature is not a defect by itself. A dash may be the clearest punctuation, a short list may be the best scan surface, and passive voice may correctly foreground the affected system. Rewrite when several features form a repeated machine-shaped pattern or when the artifact contains conversation residue that does not belong in the document.

For repository text, preserve established punctuation, terminology, and heading conventions unless the user asked for a broader style change. The goal is not to erase every recognizable model habit; it is to remove generic mediation between the author and reader while protecting meaning.

## Prefer a clean ending

End when the document has delivered its conclusion, decision, or next action. Do not append a generic summary that repeats the same points, a motivational slogan, or an offer to continue. A useful final sentence can name the remaining uncertainty or required action; otherwise, stop.

Prefer a direct revision over a commentary about the revision. The final text should read as authored content, not as a record of how an assistant improved it.
